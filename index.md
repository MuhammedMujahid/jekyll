# About Me

I'm a front-end developer from Toronto, who is proficient with React.js. My primary focus is on developing user interface components and implementing them following well-known React.js workflows (such as Flux or Redux). I ensure that these components and the overall application are robust and easy to maintain. Commitment to sophisticated design, and quality product is my priority when producing software.
