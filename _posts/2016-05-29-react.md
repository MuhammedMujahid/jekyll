- Components in react typically have a javascript class with a state and a render component

* The output of the render method is a react element that maps to DOM element as a virtual DOM
* React reacts to the state change and updates the DOM, (Keeps virtual DOM and real DOM in sync)
* Create-react-app downloads babel, webpack
* Virtual DOM is a lightweight in memory representation of the DOM
* ES6
* Var scoped to function
* Let scoped to the block
* Only use let when you want to reassign a variable
* Else always use the const variable
* When a function is inside of an object, we call it a method
* Javascript: walk: function() {} es6: walk() {}
* Javascript: person.name es6: person[name]
* You use bracket notation when you don’t know which value you want to access ahead of time
* “This” always returns reference to the current object
* Javascript: function(number){ return n\*n} es6: number => n\*n
* Map method is used to render a list
* When making a constructor in a extending class, put the “super()” keyword inside body of constructor
* Separate modules are private by default, therefore putting “export” keyword at the start of a class name \* will allow others modules to have access to them
* Import {person} from ‘./relatedpath’
* Named exports are any specific objects you want to export from a class
* Default exports are there when you want to specify a default object to export
* Default -> import … from ‘’;
* Named -> import {...} from ‘’;
* It is possible for a module to have both a default and named export
* Import Teacher, { promote } from “./teacher”;
* Installing BOOTSTRAP
* Npm i bootstrap@4.1.1
* Import in index.js “import ‘bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css”
* Components
* Components with .jsx extension have better code completion
* Imrc -> import react component
* Cc -> create class
* You can apply styles through jsx expressions
* To render lists, use the .map method and use keys to uniquely identify elements
* When changing a state variable, you must use .setState to update the state afterwards
* this.setState({ movies });

* When passing event arguments use an arrow function
* onClick{ () => this.handleIncrement(Product)}
* MAP FUCKING FUNCTION to render list

* <ul>{this.state.tags.map(tag => <li>{tag}</li>)}</ul>
* The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided \* function.
* const result = words.filter(word => word.length > 6);
* Return should only return one jsx element, if it returns more than one, than you wrap it in <React.Fragment>
* Input to component tag are called props
* Attributes should be only be modified by whom ever owns it
* Controlled components don’t have their own state
* Stateless functional components get all their data from props, in this case you can use stateless \* functional components that return a function as a react element
* To use type checking, install prop-types (npm i prop-types@15.6.2)
* componentDidMount initializes when the component is rendered
* Colon sign is used to define an object property while the equal sign is used to assign a value to a \* variable
* To use routing type ‘npm i react-router-dom’ in terminal
* To start and use a react app use ‘npm i’ followed by ‘npm start’
* <Route/> tag takes two parameters 1: path=”” and 2: component={}
  <Route path="/" exact component={Home} /> use exact keyword to have tag render only when path is exactly the one defined
* An alternative to using exact keyword is using <Switch> tag to surround different routes
* When using the switch tag, order routes from most specific to least specific
* Use <Link> tag to surround routing tags, so that they behave like a single page application and don’t reload entire page, instead they will just refresh that particular page component
* <Link> tab doesn’t have attribute called href, instead it uses “to”
* <Link> prevents additional https requests to be sent to the server
* Use redirect from react-router-dom to redirect user if he enters the wrong url
* Routing Steps:
* Npm i react-router-dom
* Wrap <app/> tag in index.js with <BrowserRouter> tag
* With react, you can use the libraries you prefer to send http requests
* Componentdidmount is where you call service to load data
* A promise is an object that holds the result of an asychronous operation
* Axios http client, sends http request to get data
* Changing the UI before calling a http request will give the delusion of a faster interface
* componentDidMount() {
  axios.get(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`)
  .then(res => {
  const persons = res.data;
  this.setState({ persons });
  })
  }
* Services are used to talk to api end points
* To login a user we send a post request to the authentication endpoint and in return we get a json web \* token which is like a authentication card
* React-Native
* Advantages is it saves time and cost
* Native cross platform applicaitons
* We can have seperate pages to have one load on IOS and one load on android
* For example tabbarIOS is only available on IOS
* While ToolbarAndroid is only available on android
* Deploying via github pages
* Npm i gh-pages
* Navigate to package.json
* Add "homepage": "https://muhammedmujahid.github.io/Shopping-Cart-React-App",
* "scripts": {........
  …..
  Add "deploy": "gh-pages -d build" inside scripts
  Npm run build
  Npm run deploy
  FIN.

* Expo init to make a react native project
* React native doesn’t work with regular DOM elements
* Instead you use Text and View that are imported from react-native
* View is equivalent to div
* And text is equivalent to paragraph

That's all.

If you want to make a **Project Page**, you have to use `gh-pages` branch. For **Personal Page**; `master` branch. More info [here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll/#jekylls-build-process).

## Site Setup

A quick checklist of the files you’ll want to edit to get up and running.

### Site Wide Configuration

`_config.yml` is your friend. Open it up and personalize it. Most variables are self explanatory but here's an explanation of each if needed:

#### title

The title of your site... shocker!

Example `title: My Awesome Site`

#### description

The description to use for meta tags and homepage.

#### url

Used to generate absolute urls in `sitemap.xml`, `feed.xml`, and for generating canonical URLs in `<head>`. When developing locally either comment this out or use something like `http://localhost:4000` so all assets load properly. _Don't include a trailing `/`_.

Examples:

{% highlight yaml %}
url: http://taylantatli.me/Halve
url: http://localhost:4000
url: //cooldude.github.io
url:
{% endhighlight %}

#### logo

Your site's logo. It will be shown on homepage. Also used for twitter meta tags.

#### background

Here we will set images for left block. Example:

```
background:
  homepage: images/home.png
  post-list: images/unsplash-image-10.jpg
  default-post: images/unsplash-gallery-image-3.jpg
```

<dl>
  <dt>homepage</dt>
  <dd>Is for homepage background image.</dd>
  <dt>post-list</dt>
  <dd>Is for posts list page background image.</dd>
  <dt>default-post</dt>
  <dd>Is for posts' default background image. It will be shown for every posts that don't specify any image from post's YAML front matter.</dd>
</dl>

---

### Projects Overlay

To set what image links appear in the overlay menu edit `_data/projects.yaml`. Use the following format to set the URL, title, image and project status for as many links as you'd like. If you set `completed` to `false` like `completed: false`, it won't be clickable until you set it true like `completed: true`

{% highlight yaml %}

- title: Moon Jekyll Theme

  completed: true

  image: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TaylanTatli/StartPage/master/preview.png
  completed: false
  {% endhighlight %}

## Layouts and Content

Halve Theme use [Jekyll Compress](https://github.com/penibelst/jekyll-compress-html) to compress html output. But it can cause errors if you use "linenos" (line numbers). I suggest don't use line numbers for codes, because it won't look good with this theme, also i didn't give a proper style for them. If you insist to use line numbers, just remove `layout: compress` string from layouts. It will disable compressing.

### Images for Posts

You can set left block image per post. Just add `image: some link` to your post's front matter. If you don't set this, default post image will be used from `_config.yml`.

```
image: /assets/img/some-image.png
or
image: http://example.com/some-image.png
```

This also will be used for twitter card:

![Halve Twitter Card]({{ site.url }}/images/post-image-halve-5.png)
